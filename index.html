                        of work generally depends on the size and complexity of the project.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Expect the first few days after launch to be very busy as you spread the word to your community,
                        answer questions from potential backers, and more. You may need to spend the last few days
                        rallying your social networks in order to reach your funding goal.<br>

                    <p>Projects sometimes take on a life of their own, and in that case you should expect to spend more
                        time creating and fulfilling rewards.
